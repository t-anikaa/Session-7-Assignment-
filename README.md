In Assignment 7 of Geospatial Programming Course, there are 4 questions which needs to be solved by the participants. 

>**Question 1**: For the 1st question, I have saved a copy of the provided notebook to my colab. Then, I submitted the link of the colab from my drive. I also added the drive link here.

>**Question 2**: A black and white image can be represented as a 2D array. In a grayscale image, each pixel typically contains a single intensity value, either 0 or 1, representing the brightness or darkness of that pixel. The 2D array corresponds to the grid of pixels in the image, with each element in the array representing the intensity value of the corresponding pixel. For the 2nd question, I have changed the pixel value of the black and white image provided in the notebook such as I converted 1 to 0 in some cases. Due to changing of pixel value, the provided image has also been changed which I have attached here.

>**Question 3**: An RGB image is a type of color image that is composed of three color channels: Red, Green, and Blue. These three channels combine to produce a wide spectrum of colors by varying their intensities. In an RGB image, each pixel is represented by three values, one for each color channel. The intensity values for each channel range from 0 to 255 in an 8-bit color depth, where 0 represents no intensity (black) and 255 represents full intensity (saturated color). The combination of these three channels creates a diverse range of colors through additive color mixing. For separating the RGB image into its individual color channels, I uploaded a RGB image in my google drive & run all the cells of Colab notebook. Then, I downloaded the image in which Red, Green, Blue channels are separated from Colab Runtime which has been attached here.

>**Question 4**: There are different Earth observation satellite missions such as MODIS, LANDSAT, Sentinel that play crucial roles in monitoring and collecting data about the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and environment. Each mission has its specific goals, sensors, and applications like
1. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer): Launched aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, MODIS aims to observe the Earth's surface and atmosphere with moderate spatial resolution.
2. Sentinel Missions (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3): Part of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus program, the Sentinel missions focus on providing continuous, high-quality Earth observation data for various applications.
3. Landsat Program (Landsat 1-9): Launched by NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Landsat program is one of the longest-running Earth observation programs, capturing images of the Earth's surface since the early 1970s.
For the last question, I searched in GEE data catalouge & created a table containing satellite name, bands, wavelenght, description, pixel size columns. Then, I created the PDF file of the table which you can find here.
